    For anyone interesting in using this code or why I developed this, let me be clear and state that <strong> I do not
      condone
      cheating </strong> and I've never used this program to win money on a live game. I created this as a challenge
    for myself,
    and
    to prove that I could create this on my own, without using any outside references. It was used for testing on videos of games
    I recorded
    live on my phone, which were later played back for the "live" testing.
  </p>
  <br />

  <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-5">
    How I first got the idea: <br/> <br/>
    A few months ago I came across a ted talk from someone who developed a similar application (I can't remember his
    name) - but
    because he was so bad at the game he developed an app to help him "win" at HQ Trivia. He believed that using it
    "went against the spirit of the game", and I agree with him completely which is why I've let out a large portion of
    my program, including the search algorithm I created. </p>

  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <p class="grey-text mb-md-0 mb-5">
    Simply put, this app reads in a question, searches it on Google, and compare the results with each of the 3 possible answer choices. A confidence level is then calculated and displayed for the most likely correct answer. This all happens dynamically at run time in an average of about 4 seconds.
  </p>

  <h3>Project Files/How it Works:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GoogleScraper.java</strong> : By using JSOUP java library, this class searches for a key phrase (the
      question) on google via http get requests </li>
    <li><strong>ScreenData.java</strong> : A model class for housing the question information and confidence values</li>
    <li><strong>TextRegions.java</strong> : This class uses a third party java library, Tesseract. Tesseract is an OCR
      (optical character recognition) library which monitors sections of the screen for images containing text. After using some quick math of the devices screen rations, Tesseract will know where to look for the question and it's 3
      possible answers. The text is extracted and now ready to search and process. </li>
    <li><strong>ColorChangeChecker.java</strong> : Using the Java AWT Robot class, this class is responsible for
      continuously analyzing 3 unique pixels on the screen of the device playing the game. When these 3 pixels become true (i.e. their colors match
      predtermined colors which ONLY appear while a question is being displayed, and the 10 second countdown has
      started), it rejoins the main thread and always the program to continue. Sure, we could have a button to click every time, but why not relax and involve some automation? </li>
    <li><strong>Driver.java</strong> : The main application entry point - this class houses the UI, search algorithms,
      and functional maintenance between the containing objects. </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Problems I ran into, and what I would change if I did it again: </h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>REGEX with Google </strong>: An unforseen consequence of using OCR is the slight variations between text
    characters which can corrupt the data being fetched. For example, the difference between a tick, ' , and ,`, as well as
    different types/fonts of quotation marks, commas, and letters with tilda's or accents over them ended up being a
    huge problem when it came to accurately searching through the data. While these could be considered corner
    cases, they happened enough where I had to invest a lot of effort in correcting all possible outcomes. </li>
  <li><strong>Using the ColorChangeChecker</strong>: When the question is displayed on the screen, there are 3 points
    which have a RGB value of (255, 255, 255). All three of the points reflect this color when and only when a question
    is appeared. It quickly become apparent that while for some games this was true, for others the value would be an
    ever slighty different shade of white (with a 254 or 256). This would cause the program to continue waiting for a
    question instead of executing, and it took a while to find this bug. This was solved by dynmically checking the
    initial color point at those locations during the first question, and then using that color as the control for the
    remainder of the game</li>
  <li><strong>Code maintainability</strong>: If I could redo this project, I would have invested a lot more time in
    project structure and functions centered around code reusibility (as any good developer should ðŸ˜…). What I thought
    would be a smaller project ended up growing really fast, mostly due to so many data and search corrections that
    needed to be checked for.</li>
</ul>
