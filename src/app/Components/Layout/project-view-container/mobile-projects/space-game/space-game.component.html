    <h3>About this project: </h3>
    <p>This project was created with SpriteKit and Xcode. I wanted to understand more about target bitmasks, and the physics world when two or more SpriteNodes meet and how to handle the collisions. The explosion is generated with a Sprite Emitter effect, and includes a few sound effects. </p>
