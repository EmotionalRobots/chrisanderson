    <h3>About this project: </h3>
    <p>This is one of the first games I remember playing on my iPhone, so for one of the first apps I ever created, I wanted to give it a go at recreating it.
        
    </p>
<!-- <br /> -->
    <p>The game is simple - a randomly colored ball is dropped, and you need to tap the wheel to align the matching color before the ball lands. The ball's gravitational speed increase by 20% every 10 balls.</p>
